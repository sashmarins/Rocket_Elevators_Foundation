---------------API-------------------
======================================
We use figaro gem for setting environment variables.
The gem reads a config/application.yml file and sets environment variables before anything else is configured in the Rails application.
You can add environment variables as key/value pairs 


* FRESHDESK :
When a customer sends quote request or contact request, new ticket is created on FreshDesk API, domain name codeboxx777.freshdesk.com 
The ticket contanins client's contact information and information that the client fills up in quote request or contact form, which customer support of Rocket Elevators can work with, in order to complete client's request.
If an employee fills out the --brand new-- interventions form, a new ticket will be created on freshdesk domain davemustaine.freshdesk.com, containing details of the intervention.
